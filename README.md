# Personal-Website

My evolving personal website source code. 

This is a simple static website deployed using _Netlify_ designed to showcase my current and upcoming projects . This website uses my own custom CSS stylesheet and JavaScript to display animations. Feel free to use any part of this website for personal or public use.
